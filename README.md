## ✨ Core Features
- **PIN-Protected Access**: Files are only accessible via a 6-digit PIN you provide to the receiver.
- **Auto-Expiry**: To ensure security, shared files automatically delete after 10 minutes.
- **No Account Needed**: Instant "Drop and Go" functionality—no registration required.
- **Privacy First**: Files are never publicly indexed or shared outside of your PIN.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite for high-speed performance.
- **State Management**: React Hooks.
- **Accessibility**: Optimized with ARIA labels and semantic HTML.
- **SEO**: Fully configured with JSON-LD WebApplication schema for Google indexing.

🛡️ Security & Privacy
VedDrop is built to solve the problem of "temporary sharing." Unlike cloud storage (Drive/Dropbox), VedDrop is designed for one-time transfers where you don't want the file to exist on the internet forever.
